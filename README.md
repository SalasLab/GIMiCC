Welcome to the GIMiCC GitHub Repository!

NOTE: GIMiCC currently relies on data within the current development version of ExperimentHub (3.19).

To successfully run GIMiCC in it's development version, we reccomend the following
1. Download the development version of R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html)
2. Install the development version of Bioconductor (3.19) as shown [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html)
3. Due to package compatability issues, you will need to locally download the package "rtrackerlayer" under Bioconductor v3.18 [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html)
