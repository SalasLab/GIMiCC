\title{Function to perform GIMiCC hierarchical deconvolution}
\usage{
GIMiCC_Deconvo(Betas, h = 5, tumor.type = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{Betas}{A matrix (CpG as rows, samples as columns) of DNA methylation data
presented as beta values. 450k, EPIC and EPICv2 platforms are accepted.}

\item{h}{The hierarchical level of resolution desired. Parameter must equal one of
the following {0,1,2,3,4,5}. The larger the number, the higher the
resolution where level 0 provides estimates for only "Tumor" and "Non-Tumor"
fractions whereas level 5 provides estimates for all 18 cell types.}

\item{tumor.type}{Must be one of the following {"AST-HG","AST","GBM","OLG"} as
defined by the Capper et al molecular classifier. AST-HG is for high-grade
astrocytoma, AST is for astrocytoma, GBM is for glioblastoma,
and OLG is for oligodendroglioma.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of cellular composition estimates per sample, scaled to sum of
100\%.
}
\description{
Given DNA methylation microarray data as an input, this function will
estimate the relative composition of the sample. At the highest resolution,
this will include 18 cell-types. Users may also specify lower resolution
estimates as well to observe trends in broader cell populations.

\examples{
## Grabbing data
library(ExperimentHub)
Example_Beta<-query(ExperimentHub(), "GIMiCC")[["EH9482"]]

## Using GIMiCC
GIMiCC_results <- GIMiCC_Deconvo(Example_Beta, tumor.type = "GBM")
head(GIMiCC_results)
